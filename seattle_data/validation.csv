I encourage you to explore the many different communities Seattle has to offer.  Roosevelt is growing! Seattle is experiencing a boom.  More people and a  new light rail station now under construction in the neighborhood has led to numerous development projects being planned or under construction. You may notice older homes in the area boarded up as developers plan for new apartments to meet growing housing demands.","24 hour Access: The house is outfitted with keyless locks on all the main doors.  You can use the general code sent upon reservation confirmation or request a personal 4-digit code just for you. Parking:  Free, uncontrolled parking is available close by.  The best place to park is on NE 68th St. behind the high school (across the street). These spots are free, uncontrolled and available. Park all day for free!  15th Ave NE in front of the house has NO Parking during rush hours and the city will tow. :(   Other side streets are also controlled and can result in parking tickets - ugh!  Accessibility: While safe, my house is not ADA compliant. There are two flights of stairs from the street and another narrow set of stairs to the second floor suite.

Perhaps it's the diversity of the businesses and attractions that brings such a diverse group of people to this neighborhood. Highlights include the Broadway Farmers Market, a seasonal fiesta of food, flowers and music; Cal Anderson Park, which is full of dog walkers, Frisbee players and children dipping their toes in the streaming fountain; and the Pike/Pine Corridor's vintage clothing stores, furniture shops and coffeehouses.

However, guests with disabilities or trouble climbing stairs should still take this into consideration.  There are not any pets inside the room, nor have there been any pets since the place opened, but some other tenants in the building do have cats.

There is free two-hour parking around the area that go between 7am-6pm (unrestricted after 6pm), and it can be easy or difficult depending on what day and time you arrive. Much of the parking can be found on Melrose, past Olive Way until Denny Street. I've also been told there is parking north of Thomas street. Parking enforcement does patrol the area so I would recommend moving the car every two hours during the restricted timeframe. Otherwise, there are pay parking sites nearby, that charge a daily rate of about $13. On Sundays, parking is free throughout Seattle.

I know the area very well and can offer great insights if you let me know a bit about what your plans are and what you would like to do and explore. As for me, recently I have been spending a lot of time on my new boat and doing restoration work. I'm around and responsive to general questions or recommendations. My dog:I have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. A little more about my background if your curious:I am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. I'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. I'd love to have my guests join when that time comes.

When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.

I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes.

I know the area very well and can offer great insights if you let me know a bit about what your plans are and what you would like to do and explore. As for me, recently I have been spending a lot of time on my new boat and doing restoration work. I'm around and responsive to general questions or recommendations. My dog:I have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. A little more about my background if your curious:I am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. I'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. I'd love to have my guests join when that time comes. In the meantime I am dedicated to making sure your Airbnb experience is a great one.  ",within an hour,100%,100%,f,"https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/1382925/profile_pic/1429155577/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/1382925/profile_pic/1429155577/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Capitol Hill,3,3,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'linkedin', 'reviews', 'kba']",t,t,"12th Avenue East, Seattle, WA 98102, United States",Capitol Hill,Broadway,Capitol Hill,Seattle,WA,98102,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.62360708,-122.3172353,t,Apartment,Private room,2,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Indoor Fireplace"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Safety Card"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo}",,$89.00 ,,,,$10.00 ,1,$10.00 ,1,14,3 weeks ago,t,30,60,90,365,1/4/16,193,10/27/13,12/28/15,90,9,9,9,9,10,9,f,,WASHINGTON,f,strict,f,f,2,7.244277026,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4277026,2.01601E+13,1/4/16,Bright and spacious Cap Hill room,"Lovely private room with large bay windows and high ceilings in the center of Capitol Hill.

My street is typically a lot quieter than one of the main drags, but there is a nearby bar that can be noisy.  The apartment also gets a lot of light from the big windows, even at night. If you are sensitive to light the opaque pull-down shades are very effective. If you're not familiar with old shades they can be a bit tricky to roll up though! Best practice is to create firm tension by pulling down and then release quickly; repeat as necessary, increasing tension each time. The building is old, so sometimes the water pressure and temperature vary in the shower. It never gets too hot or too cold and it always corrects itself in half a moment, but it's something to keep in mind.

Parking available, beyond the basics amenities - perfect for business, getting ready for an event or exploring the city. Easy 24hr check in. No cleaning fee & parking available for $10/night. This is a top floor corner unit in an old world charm building. Please note there is NO ELEVATOR. I have a fully stocked kitchen if you feel like making a meal. Bathroom has your basics such as body wash, shampoo & conditioner as well as a few extras like a flat iron, hair dryer, and some styling products. Forgot something? Toothbrush? Toothpaste? Dental floss? Q-tips? Razor? Don't worry I got you covered!  Please note that this is an older building with hardwood floors in the middle of the most lively neighborhood in town.

From artsy creative types to high tech. This is a lively and thriving neighborhood not for the faint of heart. There is always something to do, a show to see, a new restaurant to try, or a festival to attend. This is also Seattle's 'gayborhood' - if being surrounded by rainbow hair, glitter & feather boas doesn't sound like your cup of tea this may not be the place for you. We welcome everyone here but we expect those who come visit our neighborhood to respect our community.    The apartment is near everything - you can walk to the grocery store, coffee shops, boutiques, yoga studio, tons of restaurants and anything else you might be interested. Looking for something specific? Just ask - I'd be happy to point you in the right direction!","If you need parking, a hair appointment, dry cleaning or laundry pick up service, would like me to arrange a personal chef, or set up the room with flowers & champagne to celebrate you special day I would love to do that for you but will need advance notice. Also, price will need to be negotiated in advance and included in a Special Offer through AirBnB (unless you are trying to surprise your sweetie in which case I will accept PayPal).  If you're looking for a shorter/longer stay than my usual parameters please feel free to send me a message - I may be able to accommodate you.","The apartment is right on several major bus lines. You can easily catch a bus downtown, SLU, Seattle Center, Convention Center, UW, Eastside or almost any other neighborhood nearby. We also have several Pronto bike sharing stations nearby - Seattle has a huge bike culture! You can Uber or Lyft to numerous neighborhoods nearby anywhere from $5-$15 on average. If you have a car I-5, 520 & I-90 are all nearby - however, parking can be a real pain around the neighborhood. If you must have a car and need help navigating parking, let me know and I'll see if I can arrange a parking spot for the duration of your stay.  Also, there are several 24hr grocery stores nearby and Safeway is just a block away.",https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/159c6e95-4a3a-4187-941f-6b5d9fe6eea2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/159c6e95-4a3a-4187-941f-6b5d9fe6eea2.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/159c6e95-4a3a-4187-941f-6b5d9fe6eea2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/159c6e95-4a3a-4187-941f-6b5d9fe6eea2.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,595610,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/595610,Elena,5/17/11,"Seattle, Washington, United States",I love to travel & meet new folks from around the world!

If you prefer hidden local places, we got plenty of those as well and If you are staying with us over a weekend, there is a delicious local farmers Market happening on Sundays just a stone throws away. We are a fifteen minute walk from Convention center/downtown, a ten minute bus ride door to door, or a $6 Uber.

The city has also just put in the ""Pronto Bike"" share program making renting bikes easy and cheap with stations all over including one a few blocks from us. Because we are so close to downtown and in a very dense neighborhood, parking can be very rough. We highly suggest not having a car if you can get by without one. Unfortunately we cannot offer parking and all the street parking around here is zoned (though overnight from 4 pm-9 am is free).",https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/c2cd6688-a122-4352-a708-2a3878cb05d9.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/c2cd6688-a122-4352-a708-2a3878cb05d9.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/c2cd6688-a122-4352-a708-2a3878cb05d9.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/c2cd6688-a122-4352-a708-2a3878cb05d9.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,5820099,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5820099,Forest And Andy,4/7/13,"Seattle, Washington, United States","Hello!

I'll be your go-to gal for all questions on bookings. Mark Chambers and Oda Egeland have owned St. John's since January 2005.  When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!A little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. I wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there! I've been pondering this nugget lately: ""trade your cleverness in for awe.""

Please be aware of this if you have a later check-in.","From the airport you can catch the light rail for $3 one way to the Westlake station in Downtown. From there a quick $4-$6 Uber ride or 25 min walk uphill will get you to the apartment. Once at the apartment we are close to several major bus lines. You can easily catch a bus downtown, SLU, Seattle Center, Convention Center, UW, Eastside or almost any other neighborhood nearby. We also have several Pronto bike sharing stations nearby - Seattle has a huge bike culture! You can Uber or Lyft to numerous neighborhoods nearby anywhere from $5-$15 on average. If you have a car I-5, 520 & I-90 are all nearby - however, parking can be a real pain around the neighborhood.  Coming soon!! The light rail will be opening it's first of many extensions 2 blocks from the apartment on Broadway in March of 2016!!  The Capitol Hill Station will take you to and from the airport for $3 one way!",https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/9b1b4014-1e71-4c1f-82ab-8c194ceda5c5.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/9b1b4014-1e71-4c1f-82ab-8c194ceda5c5.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/9b1b4014-1e71-4c1f-82ab-8c194ceda5c5.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/9b1b4014-1e71-4c1f-82ab-8c194ceda5c5.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,46422666,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/46422666,Michael,10/12/15,"Seattle, Washington, United States","I work as a registered nurse in the Seattle area.

Looking for something specific? Just ask - I'd be happy to point you in the right direction!","If you need parking, a hair appointment, dry cleaning or laundry pick up service, would like me to arrange a personal chef, or set up the room with flowers & champagne to celebrate you special day I would love to do that for you but will need advance notice. Also, price will need to be negotiated in advance and included in a Special Offer through AirBnB (unless you are trying to surprise your sweetie in which case I will accept PayPal).  If you're looking for a shorter/longer stay than my usual parameters please feel free to send me a message - I may be able to accommodate you.","The apartment is right on several major bus lines. You can easily catch a bus downtown, SLU, Seattle Center, Convention Center, UW, Eastside or almost any other neighborhood nearby. We also have several Pronto bike sharing stations nearby - Seattle has a huge bike culture! You can Uber or Lyft to numerous neighborhoods nearby anywhere from $5-$15 on average. If you have a car I-5, 520 & I-90 are all nearby - however, parking can be a real pain around the neighborhood. If you must have a car and need help navigating parking, let me know and I'll see if I can arrange a parking spot for the duration of your stay.  Also, there are several 24hr grocery stores nearby and Safeway is just a block away.",https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/a0aeeb9f-4581-4a98-a7f4-93524dcffe8e.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/a0aeeb9f-4581-4a98-a7f4-93524dcffe8e.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/a0aeeb9f-4581-4a98-a7f4-93524dcffe8e.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/a0aeeb9f-4581-4a98-a7f4-93524dcffe8e.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,595610,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/595610,Elena,5/17/11,"Seattle, Washington, United States",I love to travel & meet new folks from around the world!

Other  recent trips have been in Africa (the Seychelles, Uganda, Namibia and South Africa), China, Italy/Corsica and Malaysia. Even though I'm a civil engineer who loves cities, I'm strangely drawn to remote islands - the Orkneys, the non-touristy Greek ones like Folegandros, or even just the little islands in Lake Bunyoni. This summer I've gotten to explore more of the Pacific Northwest - from Bellingham to down the Oregon Coast and the California redwoods. My best travel experiences have been with great hosts, and to pay that back I would love to provide a comfortable home-like experience for our guests, including access to a fully-stocked kitchen, a private bathroom, and a bedside table.[Saul]  I never traveled far from Chicagoland as a kid but have gradually been opening up to it since I moved to Seattle in 1998.  My first overseas trip was with Megan to Iceland when we first met, and last year we visited Europe (London, Amsterdam & Copenhagen).  I would love to visit Japan someday.I enjoy meeting new people and sharing life experiences.

Our guest parking pass for Zone 21 is included, which means the 2hr street parking limit increases to 72hrs with Zone 21 pass displayed.

We live in Ballard, which has been called ""the most soulful"" neighborhood in Seattle. We think of it as the 21st arrondissement of Paris: the Farmers Market, the boutiques, the little coffee bars and boÃ®tes. Our house is located one mile north of historic Ballard, close enough for a leisurely walk through this quaint, friendly neighborhood, and yet, far enough away to park easily and sleep undisturbed from others coming and going from all of the wonderful restaurants and bars this neighborhood has to offer! More info about Ballard:  + a 5-minute drive from Golden Gardens beach (with amazing sunset views of Elliot Bay and the Olympic Mountains)  + a 20-minute drive from downtown (or, a 30-minute bus ride if you'd prefer to avoid the expense of parking)  + a charming neighborhood, home to dozens of quaint boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants featuring many different types of cuisines (French, Mediterranean, Greek","Guests who are staying 4 nights or more are invited to use our laundry facilities free of charge; however, we ask that you limit your laundry use to 2 loads per week.

Please don't start any laundry before 10:30 p.m. We are happy to share the back deck and backyard common areas with our guest. We also have a secured garage if you need to store a bike or two. Guests who stay with us should be comfortable using stairs. There are 4 stairs up to the guest entrance, and 10 stairs down to the basement apartment.","Old Ballard, the historic neighborhood is nearby our house, only a 15-20 walk, or a 5-minute drive away, so the vibrant night-life is nearby even though our house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Public Transport:  + Our house is located 3 blocks away from the bus to downtown Seattle in 20-30 minutes (on the #15,  or RapidRide D lines) - schedules can be found here on the Metro King County site.  + From the airport, SeaTac, you can take the Link Light Rail for about $2.75 and 40-minute ride to Westlake Center in downtown Seattle.

We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, AU, to include a few locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities such as Vancouver, Canada,  Portland and Bend in Oregon, San Francisco and Sonora, CA, Baltimore, Miami, and New York City and Ithaca, NY, and London, Cornwall and Bath in the United Kingdom. We've been a guest in 21 different Airbnb locations over the past 3-1/2 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb.
