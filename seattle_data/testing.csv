I hope, even though I won't be traveling far any time soon, that I can meet fun and interesting people through Airbnb, whether from outside my city or outside my country.I love ethnic food and often spend time in the International District, pretending that I'm overseas (which isn't hard to do!).  I get outside as much as possible to hike, walk my dogs, bike, hang out on the beach, or just relax in my backyard with my kids.  Social justice is my passion, and I want to do all I can to help people who are undervalued and underrepresented.  Often the books I read and movies I watch have that theme, and I like to spend my free time volunteering for non-profits who work with immigrants and refugees.I am a thoughtful host.  Having recently lived out of a suitcase for four months, I am aware of what can help make a traveler feel comfortable and at home.  I hope you'll come and visit us in the Ballard neighborhood soon!

I like to catch a Jazz or Reggae show when possible.  I love all kinds of food and I will eat anything, especially lots of spices, fish, vegetables and meats. When I travel I love to feel fully immerse into the local culture. That is why I donâ€™t hotels anymore else absolutely necessary. When I host a guest, I treat them like an old friend who visiting from another town. I want to them be as comfortable as possible and fully enjoy their stay. I tell them about places to see and what restaurants to try. I am fluent in English, French and I am learning Portuguese and Spanish.

The downstairs maintains that cabin/country charm without sacrificing any amenities.   There's plenty of charm on the outside too, with a back deck or patio to lounge during nice weather (June-Sept typically) and enjoy the flora & fauna. â€¢ Value - ""This is a lot bigger than we thought""  ""The photos don't do it justice!""

Parking downtown costs $10-20 depending on location and duration, so we often take the bus ourselves. â€¢ Lake Washington - only 5-10 minutes from us by any mode of transport, and features the Burke Gilman Trail.

I also lived in Washington DC for around 4 years.  This means that I'm an avid Cubs and Bears fan, but love the Washington Capitols, and am becoming a big Seattle Sounders fan as well.  So, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.How do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.  Or, if I'm visiting one of my old homes, I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.Favorite places so far I've visited: Ireland - great scotch!  Italy - Way too many amazing qualities to list. Austin - Wonderful live music.

When I'm not keeping up with the kids and my husband I'm usually busy as a property manager for 20 units.  My newest passion is Ingress, my son got started playing it first and then my husband started playing with him.  I started playing just for an excuse to walk around with, but I got hooked but time playing it now.  I love the mountains and hiking with the family as well as visiting our many wonderful parks and beaches.  I also love to travel over seas, some of the places I've visited are Europe, Morocco, Singapore, Mexico and Taiwan.   I enjoy cooking Chinese food for my family and friends and love to entertain.  My hobbies include meditation, kung -fu, and metaphysical studies.  I use to be a ballroom dance instructor and still love going out dancing although admittedly I don't get out as often as I would like.  I also enjoy drawing and painting and playing the flute with my kids as they play their instruments.  I really want to present a clean and comfortable living space for people to come and stay and get to know the city.  My goal was to not clutter the apartment with too many personal items so that you have plenty of space to spread out and make the space your own.  I hope you decide to stay with us.

When I'm not keeping up with the kids and my husband I'm usually busy as a property manager for 20 units.  My newest passion is Ingress, my son got started playing it first and then my husband started playing with him.  I started playing just for an excuse to walk around with, but I got hooked but time playing it now.  I love the mountains and hiking with the family as well as visiting our many wonderful parks and beaches.  I also love to travel over seas, some of the places I've visited are Europe, Morocco, Singapore, Mexico and Taiwan.   I enjoy cooking Chinese food for my family and friends and love to entertain.  My hobbies include meditation, kung -fu, and metaphysical studies.  I use to be a ballroom dance instructor and still love going out dancing although admittedly I don't get out as often as I would like.  I also enjoy drawing and painting and playing the flute with my kids as they play their instruments.  I really want to present a clean and comfortable living space for people to come and stay and get to know the city.  My goal was to not clutter the apartment with too many personal items so that you have plenty of space to spread out and make the space your own.  I hope you decide to stay with us.

I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.

I am a lover, artful life-liver. I love traveling and new experiences. I'm interested in people and their stories. I call the Northwest home, it is a beautiful place that I am grateful to know. I took my first international trip at 9 years old, to Mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters, it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people. At 17 I traveled to Brisbane Australia where I lived for two months. They drank. They were chill. At 21 I headed for Capetown South Africa, where I blessed to spend 3 months studying, traveling and building relationships. The people I met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today. At 26 I sold my car and bought a ticket to Xela, Quetzaltenango Guatemala where I spent one month with some of the most warmly-spirited people you could ever hope to meet. I attended Pop-Wuj, a local language school and community restoration group, and the Trama Textile weaving school/non-profit business, where I was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area. If you ever make it to Xela, I would check out the love-work being done in both of these spaces. Traveling the United States became a passion of mine after I road-tripped to Chicago from Seattle with one of my best friends. I was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place. I realized that even if I wasn't traveling internationally, I still had opportunities to travel in my home country, and there is just as much to 'know' and see here as anywhere else-AND SO THE ERA OF ROAD TRIPS BEGAN!. My family road tripped up and down the west-coast my entire childhood but the Midwest and South were uncharted territory for me......There are some other secret spaces and places, that are for me and my memories to hold, places and destinations so special only a wrong-turn and open heart could have made it so :)I have made the space I live in a home over the past 6 years and appreciate the evolution. I hope to meet you, hear and become a part of your story soon :) Much love, Jen",N/A,N/A,N/A,f,"https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/17937451/profile_pic/1425611748/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/17937451/profile_pic/1425611748/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Lower Queen Anne,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']",t,f,"Queen Anne Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, United States",Lower Queen Anne,Lower Queen Anne,Queen Anne,Seattle,WA,98109,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.62632061,-122.357367,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1,2,2,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",Kitchen,""Elevator in Building"",""Buzzer/Wireless Intercom"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",Essentials,Shampoo}",,$200.00 ,,,$100.00 ,$10.00 ,1,$0.00 ,1,1125,4 months ago,t,0,0,0,186,1/4/16,27,9/7/14,7/8/15,85,8,8,9,9,9,8,f,,WASHINGTON,f,strict,f,f,1,1.677109735,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7109735,2.01601E+13,1/4/16,Queen Anne 2BR-Private Rooftop Deck,"Spacious Queen Anne mid-century modern 2BR+den/2Bath condo in the shadow of the Space Needle and historic Kerry Park.

I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on.

I have recently relocated to Seattle fron a small foothills town 30 miles east, where I was a mama, a wife , and an elementary teacher, each for two decades.I chose to create a new life for myself and my pup after my daughter moved out  and needed a break from teaching, so I found this safe, yet adventurous spot that had always enjoyed and found work and community in the local beloved market two blocks up the street! I enjoy meeting new people, and love sharing my space with others. It is the first time I have lived alone in nearly 30 years ane while I love it, I have also enjoyed having wonderful kids and people stay with me. I am very patient and flexible and have plenty of energy after work, so after a quick stop to pick up my pup, we usually head out for some excersize and often I'll cook a bit later. I love to cook, sing, and  learning the ukelele. I feel very fortunate to be anle to have this lovely apartment to myself, but I would prefer helping others enjoy a vacation on a budget or a work trip where someone doesnt want to see the inside of another boring hotel room. My guests must also be flexible and not super private since i will be present at times, certainly in am and pms. I can be in any ro where you are not to give you as much privacy as possible. I know where all the sweet places are and have lived near the city all my life. I have many friends whonwould all say, ""Dana has a  kind and generous spirit and is easy and enjoyable to be around.I just got back from Taiwan ,visiting my father!I want to learn to cook vegetarian Tawanese.

There is a toaster oven to heat some leftovers up. Stick the food on the plate that is 100% white (it should save it is oven save on the bottom of it) and put it in the toaster oven. Missing/need something? Ask me! Either in person or send a message via the Airbnb app. Need to do laundry? Great! It's free! But please only use the detergent I have and only fill it up to the first line. The washer is a compact one so if you fill it more there will be lots of left over soap.","Street parking is usually easy and it is free.  Don't have a car? Check out the photos to see the closest bus routes to get you around town. Sometimes, even if you have a car it is best to leave it at home, or sign up for Car2Go if you don't want to bus!

I'm a mature woman who is passionate about hiking, healthy food, interesting cultural events and just pausing to appreciate whatever is happening right around me. I work from a home office as a business coach and author, so I am often around, but busy. My work is about helping individuals and teams use micro-structures to help them build big successes.As a host, I make space for my guests to do what they came here for and have a sanctuary in a quiet, clean, safe place to rest.  (I don't have a TV, and there is good wireless in the house.) I love to cook - if I'm cooking while you're here, you'll be invited to share.As a traveler, I travel very light, as backpacking is my passion. I like to get to know a place as the locals live it and the quirky secrets that may not be in the guidebooks. I'd rather eat great street food, than tourist versions.I love to read good writing of any kind, although I still prefer print. I love live theater, music, art, dance, and fringe performance.My word of the year is ""ease.""",within an hour,100%,100%,f,"https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/c11ed0c8-806e-4d93-88f7-f0833fa97059.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/c11ed0c8-806e-4d93-88f7-f0833fa97059.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Phinney Ridge,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'google']",t,f,"North 52nd Street, Seattle, WA 98103, United States",Phinney Ridge,Phinney Ridge,Other neighborhoods,Seattle,WA,98103,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.66595567,-122.3563681,t,House,Private room,2,1.5,1,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Safety Card"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials,Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron,""Laptop Friendly Workspace""}",,$52.00 ,$350.00 ,"$1,500.00 ",$500.00 ,$20.00 ,1,$20.00 ,1,1125,today,t,30,60,90,364,1/4/16,0,,,,,,,,,,f,,WASHINGTON,f,moderate,f,f,1,4130102,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4130102,2.01601E+13,1/4/16,Charming Greenlake Getaway,"Sweet and cozy Seattle craftsman perfectly situated 3 blocks from Greenlake and restaurants, shops and bars on Phinney Ridge.

It was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world.  We are new to the AirBnb community.  We have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out, we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy.  As an airbnb host, my number one priority is to make you feel completely at home.  I will be available as much as you want or I will stay out of your way.  The downstairs is completely separate.  You will have your privacy.  Our house is in the Laurelhurst part of Seattle.  It is fitted with everything you could possibly need to have a cozy and warm time, including a gas fireplace with a remote, full bath with heated floors.  The wifi works great.We have so many glorious memories in this house, we will do whatever we can to make your stay in Seattle great.My favorite quote is from Helen Keller, ""Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all"",  being a host for AirBnb has been a daring adventure and it has given energy to our empty nest.",within an hour,100%,100%,f,"https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/16206353/profile_pic/1410373550/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/16206353/profile_pic/1410373550/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Laurelhurst,1,1,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Northeast 43rd Street, Seattle, WA 98105, United States",Laurelhurst,Laurelhurst,Other neighborhoods,Seattle,WA,98105,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.65964048,-122.2707777,t,Apartment,Entire home/apt,4,1,2,4,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",""Pets Allowed"",Gym,""Pets live on this property"",Dog(s),""Indoor Fireplace"",Heating,""Family/Kid Friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Safety Card"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair Dryer"",Iron,""Laptop Friendly Workspace""}",,$185.00 ,"$1,100.00 ","$3,100.00 ",$100.00 ,$100.00 ,4,$20.00 ,3,30,today,t,0,28,58,146,1/4/16,15,9/23/14,12/26/15,99,10,10,10,10,10,10,f,,WASHINGTON,t,moderate,f,f,1,0.967389950,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7389950,2.01601E+13,1/4/16,Seattle Mid-Century Modern,"4 reasons to stay here at Airbnb Superhost home! 1.

I  am easily accessible if you need anything, I am happy to oblige most requests and strive to make every visitor a friend but I also will give you your space. I try to take Sundays off to rest and have time with my dog.I am also happy to  help you plan a fun day here in Seattle.  I even have a lonely planet guide to Seattle if you want to borrow it. Late arrivals  (after work day 6pm) must be communicated at booking and should be managed before hand .Also no arrivals after 10 pm unless it is an international flight that has gone horribly wrong. Ill try to accomodate you no matter what but again, lets communicate before your arrival.To earn more about our area (Georgetown) follow (copy and paste) this link(website hidden)My life motto""Life is short, art is long""",within a few hours,100%,100%,f,"https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/30559/profile_pic/1407822899/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/30559/profile_pic/1407822899/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Georgetown,5,5,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Airport Way South, Seattle, WA 98108, United States",Georgetown,Georgetown,Other neighborhoods,Seattle,WA,98108,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.55004279,-122.3177987,t,Other,Private room,2,3,1,1,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",""Air Conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",""Pets live on this property"",Dog(s),Heating,""Smoke Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo}",,$75.00 ,$430.00 ,"$1,300.00 ",$100.00 ,$10.00 ,1,$10.00 ,2,30,3 weeks ago,t,0,0,0,272,1/4/16,20,7/1/14,9/17/15,90,9,9,10,10,9,9,f,,WASHINGTON,f,moderate,t,t,5,1.0810060388,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10060388,2.01601E+13,1/4/16,Craftsman Farmhouse in Seattle,"A spacious Craftman farmhouse with modern updates across the street from Seattle's largest urban farm.

Beautiful views of downtown Seattle and just a generally nice drive (or walk!) along the beach/shoreline.",,"There is on street parking right in front of my house. Additionally, the driveway is sometimes available if I'm parked inside my garage. There is a bus one block away that is very convenient and takes about 20-30 minutes to get to downtown Seattle. It stops in the International District and then travels through the middle of downtown. Further stops north are near Greenlake and Fremont.

I made it as comfortable as possible for you, but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word,  basementness. If you are short, on a budget, or used to the youth hostel lifestyle, this may be the place for you. I am a professor at the UW, here in Seattle.  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  When I was eleven years old, I saw Star Wars Episode 4, and I haven't been able to concentrate since then. Even though I am solidly into middle age, I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood, and I still go see live music a couple times a month.  In my twenties and thirties, I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year.  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  I decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit Seattle on a budget. I have traveled all over the world, maybe I have visited your town? What type of place is this?Are you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  If so, you should probably move on.  This is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  Basements have LOW ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  In the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   It has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a TV, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... If you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. Basically, this is a Hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you.  You can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to Broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...What type of host am I?You may never even see me.

Leave the key on the kitchen table.

Though it's sometimes criticized for being chalky, we think that a well-prepared French press is actually quite pure. But be careful: Of all methods, French press is perhaps the most vulnerable to over-extraction. For this reason, it's necessary to transfer the entire contents of your pot to a cup or carafe immediately ","Bus transportation works here. The 5 and the 28 are good choices.

I love to travel.  I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to France.  2016 will be my 4th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  2016 Holiday SeasonHoliday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  Summer SolsticeThe famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  The NeighborhoodAs to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.FOODIE w/o gluten!!After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.MORE...For myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  AND this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.

It has a blend of whimsical creativity, a stellar hillside location on Lake Union and the canal, and continuous things to see and do in a comfortable, neighborhoody way. It's casual and low key, with a lingering hippie vibe. And our wedding reception was at the Lake Washington Rowing Club. Yes, it's on Lake Union, but, well, that's Fremont. The building is immediately located in a very Fremontian convergence of single family, multi-family & light industry, so there are small apartment buildings, single family homes and a busy ventilation company all in the same vicinity.  Sometimes it can be noisy, and at other times surprisingly quiet. For entertainment, there is the annual Fremont Solstice Parade, the 4th of July fireworks plus the year-round Sunday market. Then there are the permanent sculptural fixtures such as the troll sculpture with its VW Bug under Hwy. 99, the Rapunzel neon light ","There is NO television. We do have good WI-FI. The fireplace is not currently operational. We added sound channeling to the ceiling to reduce noise transfer, but you can hear muffled footfalls etc. from the Airbnb apartment above. To reduce noise, we request that they not wear shoes either. If you hear a funny thump, thump, thump like Christopher Robin dragging Pooh Bear down the stairs, it's actually cars hitting the road seams on 2nd Ave NW. If you are a light sleeper, this may be bothersome early morning and late evening. We just finished remodeling the last of the 5 apartments and are happily turning our sights to landscaping.

Hey, we've got a giant troll, an original giant soviet era statue of Lenin, a cold war era rocket that lights up, and an almost life sized model of the planet Saturn.  Who doesn't love Saturn?!?!  Fremont is a very safe neighborhood with many really good restaurants opening all the time.  There are several live music venues that I'd be happy to direct you towards.  We've got a fantastic organic grocery store a couple of blocks away, a gluten free bakery just down the street, and a Belgian beer hall around the corner.  There's America's first (and maybe still only?) fair trade, organic chocolate factory 3 blocks away.  They give tours for $7 every day and all the free samples you can ","Because of confusion about my request not to come in and out the front way I have removed my actual address.  The given address will get you to where you should be after which, if you follow the directions, you're about 100 feet away.  If you need an address for your GPS you can enter 3803 Fremont Ave N.  This is NOT my address but will get you to the corner of 38th and Fremont Ave N.  Follow the directions in from there. I want people to understand that this is a self contained unit but one that is connected to a house that creative people live in.  There are bbq's and music and laughter.  I sound proofed it pretty well so it's not noisy, but neither is this a quiet retreat.  One of the housemates downstairs does some sound recording of local bands.  Contrary to what you might think, it's not loud but quite the opposite.  When he's recording quiet tracks, we may ask you to try and not make any loud, banging sounds as the mics can pick them up.  I'm not talking about tip toeing around ","All kind of public transit runs through here.  It's about a 10 minute bus ride to downtown from several bus stops, all within 2 or 3 blocks.  You can sign up for car2go and just grab your own smartcar and pay by the minute.  Or, from here, you can just walk everywhere and use the bicycles for the longer trips! If it's between renting a car and using car2go I'd totally go with the latter but, if you do have a car, parking isn't bad considering it's a dense urban neighborhood.  Just read the signs carefully as parking enforcement is ruthless.  I'd be happy to advise you on the ""good spots"" where you can just park your car and forget about it.  Of course, as in most cities, don't tempt thieves by leaving stuff lying around in your car. And also, remember, come and go out the back way.  Have I mentioned that yet..?
